# Multi-stage build: build the frontend, embed it into the Go binary, then ship
# a tiny runtime image. This is the "anyone can run it" path (web app on :7171).
#
# For multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) the heavy stages run on the builder's NATIVE
# architecture and cross-compile, instead of emulating the whole toolchain under
# QEMU — the frontend is arch-independent JS, and the Go binary cross-compiles
# cheaply (CGO disabled). Only the small runtime stage is the target arch.

# 1) Build the React frontend (same output for every target arch).
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:22-alpine AS web
WORKDIR /app/web
COPY web/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY web/ ./
RUN npm run build

# 2) Cross-compile the Go binary for the target arch on the native builder.

# 3) Minimal runtime (target arch). Chromium is included because the ScholarOne
# widget drives a headless browser to log in and read the journal dashboards;
# the rest of the app works without it.
